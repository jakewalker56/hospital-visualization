== README

This is a data visualization app I built for a data science hackathon in 2014.  It uses gmaps4rails to visualize hospital locations, cost, and quality score data on a map.

There is a one-time setup step of running:

rake recreate_hospitals

This will translate the app/assets/data/hospital_summary.csv data into the Hospitals database.  Note that we currently limit hostpital import to Illinois due to a Google Maps API query limit.
